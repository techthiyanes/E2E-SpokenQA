# E2E-SpokenQA
This project aims to develope the code for end-to-end spoken question answering without any labeled transcription and ASR system.

### Running step
1. Preprocess Spoken SQuAD to link question ID to question audio file
`hash2question.py`
2. Specify the configuration in yaml file
`config.yaml`
3. Run training by `sh train.sh`
